We will go over the following options:

* training a small network from scratch (as a baseline)
* using the bottleneck features of a pre-trained network
* fine-tuning the top layers of a pre-trained network

This will lead us to cover the following Keras features:
* fit_generator for training Keras a model using Python data generators
* ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation
* layer freezing and model fine-tuning...and more.
