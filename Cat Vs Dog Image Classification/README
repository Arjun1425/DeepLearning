We will go over the following options:

* training a small network from scratch (as a baseline)
* using the bottleneck features of a pre-trained network
* fine-tuning the top layers of a pre-trained network

This will lead us to cover the following Keras features:
* fit_generator for training Keras a model using Python data generators
* ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation
* layer freezing and model fine-tuning...and more.

##Our setup: only 2000 training examples (1000 per class) and 800 testing samples. 

Data pre-processing and data augmentation:
* In Keras, this can be done via the Keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class.
