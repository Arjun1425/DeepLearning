# LeNet on MNIST Dataset

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the classic **LeNet-5** convolutional neural network architecture to classify handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**.

## Overview

LeNet-5 is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks designed for image classification tasks. It was introduced by Yann LeCun and is particularly effective for recognizing handwritten digits. In this project, the MNIST dataset is used, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits from 0 to 9.

## Architecture

The architecture of LeNet-5 used in this project is as follows:

1. **Input Layer**: 28x28 grayscale images (MNIST digits).
2. **Convolutional Layer (C1)**: 6 filters, size 5x5, followed by a sigmoid activation.
3. **Subsampling Layer (S2)**: Average pooling (2x2), stride 2.
4. **Convolutional Layer (C3)**: 16 filters, size 5x5, followed by a sigmoid activation.
5. **Subsampling Layer (S4)**: Average pooling (2x2), stride 2.
6. **Fully Connected Layer (C5)**: 120 units, followed by a sigmoid activation.
7. **Fully Connected Layer (F6)**: 84 units, followed by a sigmoid activation.
8. **Output Layer**: 10 units with softmax activation for digit classification (0-9).

## Dataset

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a benchmark dataset in the machine learning and deep learning community, consisting of:
- **Training set**: 60,000 images (28x28 pixels)
- **Test set**: 10,000 images (28x28 pixels)

The dataset is publicly available and can be easily accessed via popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
